    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Soni Mwangi a passionate Front-end and web developer who thrives on turning ideas into real,
      functional, and impactful tech solutions .
      I love building meaningful digital experiences, especially those that help people learn, grow, or connect.
      <br>
      Beyond just writing code, I specialize in developer relations, developer marketing, and ecosystem building.
      I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, people, and purpose whether it's running hackathons, building dev
      communities, or helping tech projects reach and engage the right audiences.
      I’m also skilled in project management, which helps me lead initiatives from concept to execution with clarity and impact.
      </br>
    <br>
    When I’m not coding or building communities, you’ll find me learning something new in tech, engaging with other developers, or supporting youth led innovation across Africa. I believe in using technology not just to build products, but to open doors, create access, and spark change especially for underrepresented voices in tech.

I’m also passionate about writing as a tool for impact. Whether I’m breaking down complex blockchain ideas or sharing stories from the communities I work with, I use words to educate, inspire, and amplify voices that deserve to be heard. For me, it’s all about making tech more human, more inclusive, and more accessible to the next generation of builders.

      <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
      <p>With a strong foundation in tech and a passion for empowerment, I help tech enthusiasts grow confidently and navigate the evolving tech landscape with clarity. As a Developer Relations (DevRel) professional, I work with both communities and companies creating technical content, leading developer events, and building strong feedback loops between users and products.

        I’m deeply passionate about ecosystem building, where I bring people, tools, and opportunities together to foster innovation and collaboration. I also love writing especially breaking down complex technical topics into engaging, accessible content that educates and inspires.

        As a Project Manager, I lead teams and initiatives from strategy to execution, ensuring goals are met on time and with impact. As a Front-End Developer, I craft responsive, user-friendly interfaces that bring digital ideas to life.

        Across all my roles, my focus remains the same: to drive growth, connection, and clarity in tech.
